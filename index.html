    <h1> Snakes</h1>

    <P>This question comes up quite a bit as the name Brooks, or Brooksi is thrown around a lot when referring to Florida Kings in general. The Brooks King was originally believed to be a subspecies of the Florida King, or "Floridana". It has since been debunked so to speak, and all are considered Florida Kings. For the sake of the hobby we love so much, and our obsession with categorizing everything into nice boxes, we will break it down.
            I, and many others reserve the term "Brooks" to describe Kings found in the extreme southern end of Florida usually in Dade County, but may extend to southern areas of Monroe, and Collier Counties as well. For the most part we think of them being South Dade Kings. These Kings typically display a lighter color, with an off white bone to bright yellow coloring. They also tend to have a higher band count of cross bars, and may almost look patternless as they age, and become more obscured.
            Further north near the top of Florida, the Kings look like Chain Kings with some, or no speckling in between the cross bars. It is believed that the Florida Kings in between may be a combination of these two looks, usually referred to as Peninsular Kings. However some very bright Kings have been found in pockets thru-out all of Florida not just limited to the Southern extremities.
             So in short today the term "Brooks" should be reserved for describing locality animals of extreme South Florida preferably Dade County, or descendants of wild caught parents from South Dade County.
             Keep in mind that sometimes darker specimens are sometimes found the same area, or even under the same boards as the lighter ones.  So these are generalizations, and not written in stone. I witnessed hunters bringing in bags of Florida Kings to the whole salers, and watched them separate the lighter ones as Brooks, and the darker ones as Peninsular Kings even though the hunter explained they were from the same basic area..</P>
